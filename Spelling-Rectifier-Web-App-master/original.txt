My fourh-grade son built an end table for me last week. He suprised me with it. I
think it was very sweet of him to buld it for me. It is the most elegant little table I had
ever own. I moved one of my other table out of the living room and repleced it with
new one. My dohtar commented that it didnâ€™t match the furnicure in the livng
room, but it loked fine for me. My neighbor mantioned that one of the legs of the
table was a little bit shortr than the other legs, but it looked great to me. My sister
remorked that there was a nail stiking out of the side of the table because it looked
okay to me I know the table has some imperfections, but my forth-grade son built it,
and it looks perfect to me.
